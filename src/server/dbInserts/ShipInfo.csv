582,Bantam,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Caldari State, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Bantam.

The Bantam, a strong and sturdy craft, was originally an extremely effective mining frigate. After its redesign, the Bantam's large structure had to give way for logistics systems that ate up some of its interior room but allowed it to focus extensively on shield support for fellow vessels.",Caldari
583,Condor,The Condor is fast and agile. It has limited cargo space so it's not very suitable for trading or mining. It is best used as an assault vessel in a hit-and-run type of operations.,Caldari

586,Probe,"The Probe is large compared to most Minmatar frigates and is considered a good scout and cargo-runner. Uncharacteristically for a Minmatar ship, its hard outer coating makes it difficult to destroy, while the limited weapon hardpoints force it to rely on drone assistance if engaged in combat.",Minmatar
587,Rifter,"The Rifter is a very powerful combat frigate and can easily tackle the best frigates out there. It has gone through many radical design phases since its inauguration during the Minmatar Rebellion. The Rifter has a wide variety of offensive capabilities, making it an unpredictable and deadly adversary.",Minmatar
588,Reaper,"The Reaper-class corvette is one of the smallest of the Minmatar vessels, just barely reaching rookie ship status instead of a manned fighter. The Reaper is very cheap and is used en masse in daring hit-and-run operations by Minmatars either side of the law.",Minmatar
589,Executioner,"The Executioner is another newly commissioned ship of the Amarr Imperial Navy. The Executioner was designed specially to counter the small, fast raider frigates of the Minmatar Republic; thus it is different from most Amarr ships in favoring speed over defenses. With the Executioner, the Amarrians have expanded their tactical capabilities on the battlefield.",Amarr
590,Inquisitor,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Amarr Empire, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Inquisitor.

The Inquisitor was originally an example of how the Amarr Imperial Navy modeled their design to counter specific tactics employed by the other empires. After its redesign, it was exclusively devoted to the role of a support frigate, and its formerly renowned missile capabilities gave way to a focus on remote armor repair.
",Amarr
591,Tormentor,"The Tormentor has been in service for many decades. For most of that time it saw service as a mining ship, its size barring it from making any kind of impact on the battlefield. As with most Amarr ships, however, its strong defenses always made it a tough opponent to crack, and with recent advances in turret capacitor use and damage output, its lasers have now stopped digging into dead ore and are instead focused on boring through the hulls of hapless vessels in combat.",Amarr
592,Navitas,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Gallente Federation, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Navitas.

The Navitas had been a solid mining vessel that had seen wide use by independent excavators, along with being one of the best ships available for budding traders and even for much-maligned scavengers. After its redesign, its long-range scanners and sturdy outer shell gave way entirely for remote repairing capabilities, moving the Navitas away from the calming buzz of mining lasers and into the roar of battle.",Gallente
593,Tristan,"Often nicknamed The Fat Man this nimble little frigate is mainly used by the Federation in escort duties or on short-range patrols. The Tristan has been very popular throughout Gallente space for years because of its versatility. It is rather expensive, but buyers will definitely get their money's worth, as the Tristan is one of the more powerful frigates available on the market.",Gallente
594,Incursus,"The Incursus may be found both spearheading and bulwarking Gallente military operations. Its speed makes it excellent for skirmishing duties, while its resilience helps it outlast its opponents on the battlefield. Incursus-class ships move together in groups and can quickly and effectively gang up on ships many times their size and overwhelm them. In recent years the Incursus has increasingly found its way into the hands of pirates, who love its aggressive appearance. ",Gallente

599,Burst,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Minmatar Republic, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Burst.

The Burst had been a small and fast cargo vessel. This all changed after the redesign, when the Burst found its small-time mining capabilities curtailed in lieu of logistics systems that moved its focus to shield support for friendly vessels.",Minmatar

602,Kestrel,"The Kestrel is a heavy missile boat with one of the most sophisticated sensor arrays around. Interestingly enough, it has been used by both the Caldari Navy and several wealthy trade corporations as a cargo-hauling vessel. It is one of few trading vessels with good punching power, making it ideal for solo trade-runs in dangerous areas. The Kestrel was designed so that it could take up to four missile launchers but as a result it can not be equipped with turret weapons nor with mining lasers.",Caldari
603,Merlin,"The Merlin is the most powerful combat frigate of the Caldari. Its role has evolved through the years, and while its defenses have always remained exceptionally strong for a Caldari vessel, its offensive capabilities have evolved from versatile, jack-of-all-trades attack patterns into focused and deadly gunfire tactics. The Merlin's primary aim is to have its turrets punch holes in opponents' hulls.",Caldari
605,Heron,"The Heron has good computer and electronic systems, giving it the option of participating in electronic warfare. But it has relatively poor defenses and limited weaponry, so it's more commonly used for scouting and exploration.",Caldari
606,Velator,The Velator class corvette is one of the older vessel types in the Gallente fleet. It was first deployed on the market as a fast passenger craft but the extra passenger quarters were later modified into weapon hardpoints as the newer models came to be used for small-scale security and military duties. The Velator is still a very solid mining and trading vessel.,Gallente
607,Imicus,"The Imicus is a slow but hard-shelled frigate, ideal for any type of scouting activity. Used by merchant, miner and combat groups, the Imicus is usually relied upon as the operation's eyes and ears when traversing low security sectors.",Gallente

620,Osprey,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Caldari State the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Osprey.

The Osprey originally offered excellent versatility and power for what was considered a comparably low price. After its redesign, its inbuilt mining technology - now a little creaky and long in the tooth - was gutted from the Osprey and replaced in its entirety with tech of a different type, capable of high energy and shield transfers.",Caldari
621,Caracal,"The Caracal is a powerful vessel that specializes in missile deployment. It has excellent shield defenses, but poor armor plating. Its missile arsenal, when fully stocked, is capable of making mincemeat of almost anyone.",Caldari

623,Moa,"The Moa was designed as an all-out combat ship, and its heavy armament allows the Moa to tackle almost anything that floats in space. In contrast to its nemesis the Thorax, the Moa is most effective at long range where its railguns can rain death upon foes.",Caldari
624,Maller,"Quite possibly the toughest cruiser in the galaxy, the Maller is a common sight in Amarrian Imperial Navy operations. It is mainly used for military duty, although a few can be found in the private sector acting as escort ships for very important dispatches.",Amarr
625,Augoror,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Amarr Empire the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Augoror.

The Augoror-class cruiser is one of the old warhorses of the Amarr Empire, having seen action in both the Jovian War and the Minmatar Rebellion. Like most Amarr vessels, the Augoror depended first and foremost on its resilience and heavy armor to escape unscathed from unfriendly encounters. After its overhaul, it had some of the armor stripped off to make room for equipment allowing it to focus on the armor of other vessels, along with energy transfers.",Amarr
626,Vexor,"The Vexor is a strong combat ship that is also geared to operate in a variety of other roles. The Vexor is especially useful for surveying in potentially hostile sectors as it can stay on duty for a very long time before having to return to base. Furthermore, it is well capable of defending itself against even concentrated attacks.",Gallente
627,Thorax,"The Thorax-class cruiser is the latest combat ship commissioned by the Federation. While the Thorax is a very effective ship at any range, typical of modern Gallente design philosophy it is most effective when working at extreme close range where its blasters and hordes of combat drones tear through even the toughest of enemies.",Gallente
628,Arbitrator,"The Arbitrator is unusual for Amarr ships in that it's primarily a drone carrier. While it is not the best carrier around, it has superior armor that gives it greater durability than most ships in its class.",Amarr
629,Rupture,"The Rupture is slow for a Minmatar ship, but it more than makes up for it in power. The Rupture has superior firepower and is used by the Minmatar Republic both to defend space stations and other stationary objects and as part of massive attack formations.",Minmatar
630,Bellicose,"Being a highly versatile class of Minmatar ships, the Bellicose has been used as a combat juggernaut as well as a support ship for wings of frigates. While not quite in the league of newer navy cruisers, the Bellicose is still a very solid ship for most purposes, especially in terms of long range combat.",Minmatar
631,Scythe,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Minmatar Republic the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Scythe.

The Scythe-class cruiser remains the oldest Minmatar ship still in use. It has seen many battles and is an integrated part in Minmatar tales and heritage. With its redesign, past firmware upgrades for mining output were tossed out entirely in favor of two new separate systems that focused on shield transporting and logistics drones respectively.",Minmatar
632,Blackbird,"The Blackbird is a small high-tech cruiser newly employed by the Caldari Navy. Commonly seen in fleet battles or acting as wingman, it is not intended for head-on slugfests, but rather delicate tactical situations. ",Caldari
633,Celestis,"The Celestis cruiser is a versatile ship which can be employed in a myriad of roles, making it handy for small corporations with a limited number of ships. True to Gallente style the Celestis is especially deadly in close quarters combat due to its advanced targeting systems.",Gallente
634,Exequror,"In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Gallente Federation the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Exequror.

The Exequror was a heavy cargo cruiser originally strong enough to defend itself against raiding frigates, though it lacked prowess in heavier combat situations. After its redesign, it had some of that bulk - and, necessarily, some of that strength - yanked out and replaced with the capability to help others in heavy combat situations, in particular those who needed armor repairs.",Gallente

639,Tempest,"The Tempest is one of the Republic Fleet's key vessels; a versatile gunship proficient at long-range bombardment and capable of dishing out specialized types of damage with great effectiveness. A well-rounded squadron of Tempests has been proven time and time again to be an invaluable wild card in a fleet battle, one which opponents should ignore at their own peril.",Minmatar
640,Scorpion,"The first Scorpion-class battleship was launched only a couple of years ago, and those that have been built are considered to be prototypes.

641,Megathron,"The Megathron has established itself as one of the most feared and respected battleships around. Since its first appearance almost two decades ago it has seen considerable service in the troublesome regions on the outskirts of the Federation, helping to expand and defend Gallentean influence there.",Gallente
642,Apocalypse,"In days past, only those in high favor with the Emperor could hope to earn the reward of commanding one of the majestic and powerful Apocalypse class battleships. In latter years, even though now in full market circulation, these golden, metallic monstrosities are still feared and respected as enduring symbols of Amarrian might.",Amarr
643,Armageddon,"The mighty Armageddon class is one of the enduring warhorses of the Amarr Empire. Once a juggernaut that steamrolled its way into battle, it has now taken on a more stately and calculated approach, sending out a web of drones in its place while it drains the enemy from a distance.",Amarr
644,Typhoon,"Much praised by its proponents and much maligned by its detractors, the Typhoon-class battleship has always been one of the most hotly debated spacefaring vessels around. Its distinguishing aspect - and the source of most of the controversy - is its sheer versatility, variously seen as either a lack of design focus or a deliberate freedom for pilot modification. ",Minmatar
645,Dominix,"The Dominix is one of the old warhorses dating back to the Gallente-Caldari War. While no longer regarded as the king of the hill, it is by no means obsolete. Its formidable hulk and powerful drone arsenal means that anyone not in the largest and latest battleships will regret ever locking horns with it.",Gallente

<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>
This variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.
 
<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>
When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.

The first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.
 
<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>
Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.

<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>
Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an ""incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.""",Caldari
4302,Oracle,"In YC 113 Empress Jamyl Sarum I challenged <a href=showinfo:30//500003>Amarr</a> ship manufacturers to build a new battlecruiser that would break the stalemate of the Empyrean War.

Boasting improved fittings, speed and weapon hardpoints over its standard counterpart, this ship is widely known as an invaluable wild card in any small-scale engagement.",Minmatar
32788,Cambion,"The Cambion is the result of Caldari State Executor Tibus Heth's insistence that modern weapons of war be able to continually outperform previous standardized versions. While that effort is rumored to have been hit-and-miss (resulting in great scientific advances at the cost of a stunning array of misfortunes), it is absolutely undeniable that the Cambion has been one of its great successes, a feat that likely could not have been achieved in a different political milieu. 

The Cambion is an out-and-out brawler. Taking note from the Merlin – a versatile combat frigate in its own right – this ship is intended to rush in, overheat everything it runs, hit hard with everything it has and get out moments before death can find it.",Caldari
32790,Etana,"The Etana came into existence as one of numerous secret projects under Tibus Heth's rule. As part of those revolutionary and paranoid times in the Caldari State, political emphasis on technological research was split between a need for inexpensive improvements in warfare and a need for advances in espionage and the arts of secrecy. 

One of the outcomes of that research was an improvement on the Osprey, whose versatility and low manufacturing cost made it a natural candidate for improvements. The resulting vessel maintained the shield defenses known among similar ships of its type, while adding an array of remarkable black ops capabilities. In fact, it is reputed that initial prototypes were employed to spy on interstellar activities near the recaptured Caldari Prime, as part of Tibus Heth's continually growing espionage initiative.

32811,Miasmos Amastris Edition,"The Miasmos (originally Iteron Mark IV) Amastris Edition is a limited edition cargo hauler awarded to pilots who have displayed extraordinary aptitude in capsuleer training. 

It boasts a more powerful warp engine and a bigger cargo hold capacity than the Miasmos design on which it is based, in addition to state-of-the-art lateral thrusters allowing for improved agility.

Among recent capsuleer graduates from New Eden's academic institutions, this vessel is considered a distinguished status symbol, although the quiet presence of certain unmarked, sealed containers at the back of the ship's hull tends to unnerve some of the crews.",Gallente
32840,InterBus Catalyst,"Ideally suited for both skirmish warfare and fleet support, the Catalyst is touted as one of the best anti-frigate platforms out there. Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.

Ostensibly a civilian transport corporation, InterBus claims it possesses no military capabilities. Despite this, small numbers of Catalyst hulls bearing the corporation's distinctive yellow color scheme continue to circulate among capsuleers. InterBus has thus far declined to make any comment on their provenance, which if anything has raised their value among collectors.",Gallente
32842,Intaki Syndicate Catalyst,"Ideally suited for both skirmish warfare and fleet support, the Catalyst is touted as one of the best anti-frigate platforms out there. Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.

The Intaki Syndicate fields large numbers of Catalysts as deep-space patrol craft. Its heavy armament lets it punch well above their weight, and its expansive cargo bay allows it to cruise for months between supply stops. Recently though, the Syndicate has retired a considerable number of its older hulls, with rumors suggesting their imminent replacement by a newer destroyer design. Regardless, their extensive military service gives them particular cachet among capsuleer collectors.",Gallente
32844,Inner Zone Shipping Catalyst,"Ideally suited for both skirmish warfare and fleet support, the Catalyst is touted as one of the best anti-frigate platforms out there. Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.

Inner Zone Shipping's main claim to fame is as the Bank of Luminaire's preferred courier for high-value shipments. Catalysts are their preferred escort craft, combining high speed and maneuverability with an extremely heavy punch. For its highest-value runs, IZS prefers to use brand-new hulls, which are then immediately sold off after use to prevent unscrupulous elements from tracking their ID numbers. While most of these ships are repainted and sold as stock, Inner Zone has discovered a lucrative sideline in selling a few on to capsuleer collectors, who place a premium on ships with interesting histories.",Gallente
32846,Quafe Catalyst,"Ideally suited for both skirmish warfare and fleet support, the Catalyst is touted as one of the best anti-frigate platforms out there. Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.

In its continuing campaign to gain 100% brand awareness, Quafe is constantly looking for new ways to draw attention. One of their recent successes has been the distribution of limited-edition Quafe ships to eager capsuleers, and this Catalyst is one of their latest offerings. While functionally just a stock Catalyst, this ship's iridescent blue paint job and prominent Quafe logos makes it a highly sought-after collector's item - as well as an unmissable advert for Quafe's market-leading range of thirst-quenching beverages!",Gallente
32848,Aliastra Catalyst,"Ideally suited for both skirmish warfare and fleet support, the Catalyst is touted as one of the best anti-frigate platforms out there. Faced with its top-of-the-line tracking equipment, not many can argue.

Aliastra purchased a large fleet of Catalysts several years ago, to protect its inter-Empire shipping routes. Subsequent evaluations determined that the Catalyst was considerably over-gunned for many of its safer routes, so 30% of their hulls were sold off and replaced by cheaper frigates. Some of these ships have since been retro-fitted for capsuleer use, and their distinctive color scheme makes them something of a collector's item.",Gallente
32872,Algos,"The Algos, as is custom with the Gallente, relies on swiftness of action - preferably at a respectable distance - to accomplish its goals. In this it reflects well-honed Gallente values, which include taking independent action without taking forever to wait for a committee decision, and also doing so, if at all possible, in a fashion that allows for a nice, safe buffer for immediate retreat; because theory is one thing, and practice is sometimes quite another.

As such, the Algos focuses on being able to hit its targets in rapid-fire fashion, with guns that fire fast and drones that race through space with destruction in mind.",Gallente
32874,Dragoon,"The Dragoon follows old religious tenets - ones thought rather dark by the majority of the cluster, but found perfectly normal by Amarr minds - that to exist as God's chosen people means fulfilling a very definite and often forceful role. This includes not only imposing the will of God, often through the time-honored methods of mindless proxies, but also profiting, even being nourished, off the energies of others.

As such, the Dragoon focuses on sending out a mass of drones, ones capable not only of swiftly hunting down their targets but also of inflicting tons of damage once contact is made. Moreover, the Dragoon is able to drain the target's energy in the meanwhile, all with the aim of leaving it little more than a trembling husk.",Amarr
32876,Corax,"The Corax adheres to the well-established Caldari design philosophy that there is strength in numbers, and that the messages sent to an enemy should be strong and unequivocal. This applies equally to peace talks as it does to actual engagements on the battlefield - there should be no doubt in the strength of Caldari spirit, nor in the fact that when one blow has been struck, others are going to follow.

As such, the Corax does not pepper its opponents with pellets from a gun, nor does it toast them with continuous beams of light. Instead, it delivers strong, hard-hitting payloads at a pace that's not only steady, but rapid enough to rock its targets and knock them off-balance.",Caldari
32878,Talwar,"The Talwar is redolent of the renowned Minmatar practicality in terms of battle. Irrespective of numbers, firepower and circumstances, their strategy when engaged in combat often revolves around the same central tenet: Stay untouchable as much as you can, either by sneaking around or rushing in, do as much damage as fast as you can, and get out before you get killed.

As such, the Talwar does not come equipped to hang around forever on the battlefield. It is built to rush around at speed without getting caught, and to hit very hard and very, very fast.",Minmatar
32880,Venture,"Recognizing the dire need for a ship capable of fast operation in unsafe territories, <a href=showinfo:30//500014>ORE</a> created the Venture. It was conceived as a vessel primed and ready for any capsuleer, no matter how new to the dangers of New Eden they might be, who wishes to engage in the respectable trade of mining.

The Venture has amazing abilities to quickly drill through to the ores and gases it's after, harvesting them at the speed necessary for mining in hostile space, and getting out relatively unscathed.",ORE
32983,Sukuuvestaa Heron,"The Heron has good computer and electronic systems, giving it the option of participating in electronic warfare. But it has relatively poor defenses and limited weaponry, so it's more commonly used for scouting and exploration.

This Heron bears the distinctive appearance of a vessel built for the Sukuuvestaa megacorporation. Known for extremely aggressive business practices, Sukuuvestaa is a powerful megacorporation with dealings in many sectors, most notably real estate and agriculture.",Caldari
32985,Inner Zone Shipping Imicus,"The Imicus is a slow but hard-shelled frigate, ideal for any type of scouting activity. Used by merchant, miner and combat groups, the Imicus is usually relied upon as the operation's eyes and ears when traversing low security sectors.

This Imicus has served as a forward scout for Inner Zone Shipping's high value courier operations, as indicated by its distinctive corporate coloring.",Gallente
32987,Sarum Magnate,"This Magnate-class frigate is one of the most decoratively designed ship classes in the Amarr Empire, considered to be a pet project for a small, elite group of royal ship engineers for over a decade. The frigate's design has gone through several stages over the past decade, and new models of the Magnate appear every few years. The most recent versions of this ship – the Silver Magnate and the Gold Magnate – debuted as rewards in the Amarr Championships in YC105, though the original Magnate design is still a popular choice among Amarr pilots. 

This Magnate is emblazoned with the coloring and insignia of the Sarum royal family. A visible beacon of Amarrian superiority, it was built to serve as a vanguard of the next great Reclaiming.",Amarr
32989,Vherokior Probe,"The Probe is large compared to most Minmatar frigates and is considered a good scout and cargo-runner. Uncharacteristically for a Minmatar ship, its hard outer coating makes it difficult to destroy, while the limited weapon hardpoints force it to rely on fighter assistance if engaged in combat.

This Probe was commissioned by the Vherokior tribal leadership and bears their colors and insignia. The Vherokior have less political influence than many other tribes, but have become an integral part of both the public and private sectors of the Republic economy.",Minmatar
33079,Hematos,"The Hematos is one of the smallest Blood Raider vessels in existence, though that doesn't make its appearance any less terrifying to the hapless innocents it may encounter. Like a spider, it is built to trap and drain any victim careless enough to wander into its clutches.

The Hematos is often employed by novice ship captains and staffed with crew that may not quite have mastered the art of bloodletting, which goes some way to explain its saturation of onboard cleaning systems.",Amarr
33081,Taipan,"The Taipan is one of the smaller types of Gurista vessels. While the design is based on a pre-existing Caldari ship type - the Guristas delight in stealing anything they can from their hated enemies - its internal workings have been heavily modified. Not content to rely on the Caldari's focus on missile combat, the Guristas have added the drone power of the Gallente.",Caldari
33083,Violator,"The Violator is one of the smallest of the Serpentis vessels. Its design was unceremoniously stolen from the Gallente, though its inner workings have been adapted to fit the piratical lifestyle of the Serpentis: In addition to its excellent hybrid damage, it is capable of webbing its opponents and holding them down for a further beating.",Gallente
33099,Nefantar Thrasher,"Engineered as a supplement to its big brother the Cyclone, the Thrasher's tremendous turret capabilities and advanced tracking computers allow it to protect its larger counterpart from smaller, faster menaces. The integration of the newly re-established <a href=""http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nefantar"">Nefantar tribe</a> into Minmatar society has been a trying process for all involved. One recent success has been the commissioning of a fledgling patrol fleet to protect the tribe's new spaceborne assets: as other tribes have stocked up on newer Talwar-class destroyers, the Nefantar have managed to acquire a large stock of older Thrashers for their own use. Keen to raise their visibility within the Minmatar Republic, they have been more than happy to allow willing capsuleers to acquire surplus hulls on the condition that they remain painted in Nefantar colors.",Minmatar
33151,Brutix Navy Issue,"This ship was born out of the experience gained by the Federation after the launch of the Talos-Class Attack Battlecruiser. Sensing that the Brutix hull could be refined further, it was decided to remove all notion of active defense from it to favor improvements to its already significant damage potential. The final outcome of this experiment resulted in the Brutix Navy Issue, a vessel that already shows great potential from the few skirmishes it has been into so far.",Gallente
33153,Drake Navy Issue,"After the resounding success tied to the launch of the Drake-class Battlecruiser, the Caldari Navy signed up a massive order to acquire a specific version for its own arsenals. The outcome, the Drake Navy Issue, while sharing a similar look with its step-father, serves a completely different purpose on the battlefield. Being more mobile, able to project missiles more effectively at range, against smaller targets and on a wider selection of damage types, this ship is ideal to support small scale conflicts and raids.",Caldari
33155,Harbinger Navy Issue,"While the Harbinger is a formidable vessel on its own, recent reports have raised its lack of flexibility as a noteworthy concern in the ever-shifting fleet tactic doctrines. Working hard to correct this problem, Imperial engineers came up with the improved Navy Issue variant. Boasting upgraded tracking systems, enhanced resilience and an advanced medium slot configuration layout, the Harbinger Navy Issue is a radical change over its predecessor, capable of astounding performance in a much wider spectrum of engagements.",Amarr
33157,Hurricane Fleet Issue,"In YC 115, after much heated discussion, CONCORD issued a decree stating the Hurricane-Class Battlecruiser was far too effective to stay under its current technological label, and demanded the Minmatar Republic to either cease production or sort it as a more technologically advanced craft. The Tribal Council grudgingly complied by releasing a simplified version of the Hurricane, then quickly exploited a loophole in the legislation and began using the original overpowered hull as part of its active fleet force. And that is how, after a new paint coat and renaming fees that the Hurricane Fleet Issue came to be.",Minmatar

The frigate's design has gone through several stages over the past decade, and new models of the Magnate appear every few years.<br><br>In recent times the royal Amarr Houses have shown increased interest in the design. House Tash-Murkon came to the fore in Amarr politics only after the fall of another, disgraced house, and while they possess great wealth and considerable power, some feel they do not command the respect of the original, highborn royal Houses. This Magnate is a clear statement by house Tash-Murkon that they possess all the grandeur and powerful grace required to stand beside the most pious of Amarr, and despite a few nattering voices claiming they are yet again trying to purchase divinity, most people applaud the vessel as a proper effort to honor the glory of the Almighty.",Amarr
33328,Capsule - Genolution 'Auroral' 197-variant,"This hydrostatic capsule is a unique variant on the standard model. Its golden sheen is nominally decorative material, whose role and purpose are highly classified and which dissipates entirely upon reprocessing. It is known that the capsule's regular building materials are intermixed with traces of another matter, the exact nature of which remains unknown to everyone outside Genolution's research facilities, even the capsuleers themselves. 

Theories on the subject include Fullerene Intercalated Graphite polymer for better function of internal parts without the added heat of internal friction; a meld of Fullerite-C320 and Fullerite-C540 for an extra-strength shell that can better withstand the rigors of continued operation under stress (albeit not, sadly, withstand a few direct hits from another vessel's weapon), or just a thin coating of some newly invented sheen compound.

The capsule's primary function remains to keep the capsuleer alive - even to the point of sending their consciousness to a nearby cloning vat, in the event of imminent obliteration - and allowing for the operation of the massive interstellar vessels in which the capsule is usually encased. This variant can only be operated by those capsuleers wearing the <a href=showinfo:33329>Genolution 'Auroral' AU-79</a> implant, and will be automatically replaced upon destruction.",Jove
33395,Moracha,"The Moracha is what goes bump in the night. Built to be the ultimate tool of piracy and terror, this Recon Ship combines the electronic warfare and covert abilities of its class with the speed and ferocity that Angel Cartel cruisers are known for. The first ever capsuleer ship to use the Ixion ship hull, the distinctive appearance of the Moracha goes along with incredible combat capabilities that make it ideal for both solo and wolfpack hunting.

By the time you see a Chremoas decloak, the fight is already over.",Minmatar
33468,Astero,"This was one of the first vessels the Sisters of EVE made available to capsuleers. It had been under development by the Sanctuary corporation, whose interest in exploration includes not only search & rescue operations but also a constant inquiry into the nature of the EVE Gate. Thanks to the Sisters' efforts and the Sanctuary's particular expertise, the Astero is an agile, tenacious ship that aptly adheres to the mantra of both rescuers and explorers: Stay safe, stay hidden, and use every tool at your disposal. 

It is particularly adept at venturing into dangerous territories, not merely in recovering whatever may be of interest but also in being able to safely bring it back. Its engines have alternate power sources that come into play should any of its cargo - for which it has plenty of room - cause serious interference with internal systems. Its carapace is extremely well armored for a ship this agile, and covered in sensors capable of letting its crew track a myriad of different organic signatures. The crew itself is safely protected from any number of transmittable ailments from rescues and other unexpected passengers, thanks to special quarantine bays that are conveniently located near jettisonable openings. 

And lastly, an ingenious but cryptic transfer in part of the warp core functionality to an outlying cylindrical structure means the Astero is able to run certain higher-level cloaking functions with very little technical cost, and minimal interference from warp.

The Sanctuary corporation poured uncountable resources into making the cloaking technology developed for the Stratios fit the Nestor, but were eventually forced to concede that it was impossible. The effort was not without benefit though, as part of their work focused on reducing the Nestor's mass enough that it could make its way into unexplored territories that might've been hazardous to bulkier vessels. This paid off by affording the Nestor unmatched access to wormhole space, and meant that the embedded miniature rescue vessel on the ship's hull could be relegated to a decommissioned role. With covert function off the table, the Sanctuary turned their eyes on logistics and now the Nestor serves as one of the best support platforms in New Eden.

33513,Leopard,"Rumor has it the Leopard originated as a secret project in the Minmatar Republic. In their endless battle against enslavement by the Amarr Empire, the Minmatar have had to develop ways not only to liberate large masses of their people, but also to sneak in and capture individuals of high strategic importance. 

These kinds of black ops search-and-rescue missions might be executed for key people who were held by the enemy and possessed either special qualities the resistance needed, or information the Republic couldn't afford having tortured out of them. It's notable that these individuals might not all have been Minmatar, and that the resistance movement is unlikely to have restrained itself from using the same methods on key Amarr people they'd captured with the help of the Leopard.

Additionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space mining operations around.

The martyrdom of Empress Jamyl I was inflicted with base treachery but its lasting effect will be the inspiration of a thousand generations down the ages.""</i> - excerpt from the Funeral Oration on the Passing of Empress Jamyl I by High Chaplain Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador, YC117.09.20

Following the assassination by a Drifter strikeforce of Empress Jamyl I while she was aboard an Avatar-class Titan in late August YC117, there was a period of soul-searching and close scrutiny of capital ship doctrines by the Imperial Navy's staff officers. It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.

From this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.

A well established and close co-operation between Amarr and Caldari capital warfare tacticians and naval architects all but guaranteed that the Amarr would share their conclusions on the need to alter capital warfare doctrines and accommodate such changes with updated designs and new ship concepts.

The infusion of Amarr thinking on the subject of capital ship warfare served to break a long-standing impasse between doctrinal factions in the Caldari Navy's strategic command. The wisdom of learning from the example of the most experienced capital warfare pilots in New Eden was accepted and the Minokawa-class Force Auxiliary was the eventual result.

The Republic Fleet were slow to follow the other naval powers along the new path of capital warfare inspired by capsuleer combat experience in the many wars of the Outer Regions of New Eden. In large part this was due to a flaring up of the old debate between the firepower- and maneuver-oriented generals of the Brutor dominated military circles and the logistics- and fighter-oriented Sebiestor fleet tactician and technologist circles.

After much chest-beating, and due in no small part to the intervention of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, the arguments of the Sebiestor won out and the Lif-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned over the objections of the Brutor military elite.

Military experts within the Gallente Federation were not slow in recognizing the significance of the agreements made between the Empire and State at the Amarr-Caldari Capital Warfare Summit of January YC118. The military-industrial complex of the Federation was more than equal to the task of implementing the necessary changes to existing designs in line with the concepts inspired by capsuleer capital warfare practice.

The Federal Intelligence Office additionally recommended that the Gallente build a Force Auxiliary capital of their own to maintain parity with the Amarr-Caldari alliance. The resulting crash development program created the Ninazu-class Force Auxiliary.
